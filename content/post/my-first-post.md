This is my first post. I've been trying to make a public blog on GH pages for
such a long time, and I never got around to doing it. Now, I can finally say
"ha check my blog", and mean it.

I'm currently using Hugo as the brain for my blog, and a theme called 
`hugo-brewm`. It looks really nice, and I had Gemini replicate the demo layout
because I found it really pretty. Took a couple hours of work, and I spent that
time drinking coffee and coding in a small coffee shop downstairs from the
apartment.

Above is a picture of the aforementioned coffee. 

This blog is meant to be a beautiful and brutalist peak into my brain, inspired
by the design (and home decor) philosophy of Rick Owens. I've been reading a lot
about how Owens thinks and performs daily activities, and I think its a nice
and clean way to go about life. I'm going to have to wait to make setup content
until I'm back home, but for now, I'll go ahead and brainstorm some other ideas
for blog posts. Maybe about Zelda: Tears of The Kingdom?
