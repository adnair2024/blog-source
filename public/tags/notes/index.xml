      <description>Physical Stationary That Brings Me Daily Enjoyment In a world where we use technology all day, I think using physical writing tools is really beneficial. I wake up every morning and write in my journal, about the day before. This helps me filter the important parts of the previous day in my mind, and also is a nice part of my daily routine that helps me stay active. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll show the physical tools I use in my day to day life.</description>

      <description>My relationship with markdown I use markdown every single day. It&amp;rsquo;s become an essential part of my workflow, and this started with note taking apps like Obsidian and Ulysses. When I found Neovim, everything changed. I started just making todo lists in markdown, within Neovim, and since all my notes were .md files, it was a really easy and natural way to organize my thoughts and things I had to do without switching context.</description>
