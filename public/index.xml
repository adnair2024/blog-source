      <description>I really like quality. Whether it be the technology I use, or the clothing I wear often, I really want it to reflect me and what I want out of my life. Hopefully, this blog will reflect that. I&amp;rsquo;d like to take you through the things I use every day, like my productivity setup, etc.</description>

      <description>Turning snippets into plugins that everyone can use Table of Contents The Structure of a Neovim Plugin Logic Dependencies and what they can do for you Publishing and Usage Conclusion Every Neovim power-user reaches a point when their init.lua becomes a mess of old code snippets. Since I use Markdown files every day for notes, planning and general writing, my breaking point was functions for Markdown formatting. I was tired of manually aligning Markdown tables and manually creating a Table of Contents for each file, along with streamlining embedding of hyperlinks and images.</description>

      <description>Physical Stationary That Brings Me Daily Enjoyment In a world where we use technology all day, I think using physical writing tools is really beneficial. I wake up every morning and write in my journal, about the day before. This helps me filter the important parts of the previous day in my mind, and also is a nice part of my daily routine that helps me stay active. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll show the physical tools I use in my day to day life.</description>

      <description>My relationship with markdown I use markdown every single day. It&amp;rsquo;s become an essential part of my workflow, and this started with note taking apps like Obsidian and Ulysses. When I found Neovim, everything changed. I started just making todo lists in markdown, within Neovim, and since all my notes were .md files, it was a really easy and natural way to organize my thoughts and things I had to do without switching context.</description>

      <description>This is my first post. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to make a public blog on GH pages for such a long time, and I never got around to doing it. Now, I can finally say &amp;ldquo;ha check my blog&amp;rdquo;, and mean it.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m currently using Hugo as the brain for my blog, and a theme called hugo-brewm. It looks really nice, and I had Gemini replicate the demo layout because I found it really pretty.</description>
